Last week I was at [Macalester College](http://macalester.edu)'s [Library Technology Conference](http://www.macalester.edu/libtechconference/) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This marks my third year presenting there and I just wanted to thank them and everybody who showed up for putting on yet another completely awesome conference.

A few words about LTC: LTC is a weird duck -- it's just about the only library technology conference that regularly takes place in the upper Midwest *plus* it takes place in late winter.  This probably serves to winnow down the folks who might otherwise be primarily interested in a work-paid trip to a popular vacation spot cough*monterey*cough and that, plus the minimal vendor presence (vendors are there, they've got tables set up, but they don't have input into what presentations are selected, nor do they make presentations themselves) really makes it for me. My talk's [here](http://github.com/jbfink/ltc2012) -- this marks the second LTC presentation I've done with Scott Chacon's awesome [showoff](http://github.com/schacon/showoff) framework and I'm really starting to groove on it. 

I've come to a realization over the past few months that the sorts of conferences I really enjoy going to tend to be smaller in size
