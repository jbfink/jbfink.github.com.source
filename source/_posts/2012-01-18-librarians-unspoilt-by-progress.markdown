Like a lot of technical people, I've been pretty aware of the [SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOPA) mess in the United States. I even blacked out this blog on the eighteenth, which, since I hadn't actually started posting here yet didn't really mean anything to anybody maybe, but symbolic gestures still count, right? But as the day progressed, I started getting pretty damn bummed out about things. Not because my [favourite](http://reddit.com) [sites](http://www.metafilter.com) on the [internet](http://en.wikipedia.org) were unusable, but for a far more personal reason.

Librarians are obsessed with notions of their own relevancy. We see that in [books](http://www.amazon.com/This-Book-Overdue-Librarians-Cybrarians/dp/0061431605) and blogs and such, and I think you'd have to go pretty far afield before you found a bunch of academic librarians closer to the metal wrt the relevancy debate than [my colleagues](http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/2011/05/mcmastergate_in_chronological.php). That said, I think even the most starry eyed of us, on any normal day, would concede -- with various degrees of readiness -- that the Librarian Profession Ain't What It Used To Be, that We Are No Longer The Gatekeepers Of Information, and that Peak Librarianship, Having [Happened In 1990](http://blog.oup.com/2011/06/librarian-census/) Ain't Coming Back, Ever. But lo, the eighteenth happened, and Twitter was overrun with people posting tweets like [this tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/Born_Analog/status/159708773458522112) and [that tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/49susans/status/159719011247067136) giving what I'd consider to be a pretty awful message.
