A couple of days ago I had a great time being in the [York University Libraries](http://www.library.yorku.ca) [Blog Vs. Book debate](http://ruebot.net/content/york-university-libraries-open-access-week-2012-blogvsbook) where, weirdly enough, I argued against the "Be It Resolved", viz, against the notion that the blog should replace the book. Counterintuitive, maybe, and I admit that I had to really *think* about it before I could make a convincing argument. My side won, but listen, it was a *totally* stacked deck, see? A debate about the worthiness of books taking place *in* a library is going to attract the kind of audience that likes books. Not to mention the fact that my partner was A) really prepared and B) laid the nostalgia trip on *heavy*, pulling the proverbial Cat out of the [Hat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_in_the_hat) to argue the point that something about books, their very *container* and *format*, is a kind of magic. The [other](http://twitter.com/ianmilligan1) [side](http://twitter.com/qui_oui) made all the great arguments about speed of dissemination, accessibility, fluidity of commentary. In the end, where who won was determined by applause, they had [a single, brave badass](https://twitter.com/timothybristow) on their side and would have had one more but I would have felt super awkward banging my own hands together while sitting at the "BOOK" table.

Make no mistake, I understand the nostalgia/magic argument. I am of a Certain Age, and a great deal of you reading this right now are probably [twelve](http://twitter.com/adr/status/251711492615983106), and so I remember in a way that maybe you don't about wandering the stacks and finding stuff by serendipity. In 1995-ish, it was in a tiny weird cramped bookstore in Singapore's Holland Village where I found [Murakami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_murakami)'s [A Wild Sheep Chase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wild_Sheep_Chase), and who knows how much stuff I found just wandering the [stacks](http://www.hepl.lib.in.us/) of [various](http://www.lib.muohio.edu) libraries growing up. Depending on this nostalgia to move [support](http://boingboing.net/2012/06/16/award-winning-book-burning-hoa.html) for libraries works now but will have vanishing returns in the future. 

So, the debate. I argued on the only grounds that I could; technological and ethical. I talked about scarcity -- scarcity of access to tech and economic scarcity, I talked about the [immutability](http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/you-dont-own-your-kindle-books-amazon-reminds-customer-1C6626211) of print.  I talked about power (in this case, electrical power). I talked about obsolescence and how tech isn't really replaced all that easily unless new technology *completely* obliterates the old. TV didn't kill radio, the Internet didn't kill TV. But radio probably did kill the telegraph. Disruptive technology makes everybody jostle for a new position, sure, but it rarely kills anything off.
